INSTALLING ZoIP ON DEBIAN-BASED SYSTEMS
---------------------------------------

1. Extract the ZoIP tarball to a suitable location

   i.e.
   
      mkdir -p /usr/local/games
      cd /usr/local/games
      tar -xzf <path to archive>/zoip.tar.gz
      ln -s zoip-<version> zoip

2. Copy the example configuration file zoip/etc/zoip.conf.example to
   zoip/etc/zoip.conf, and change values as you see fit. The defaults should
   meet your immediate needs.

3. Install Sphinx2, and Festival

   Install the Sphinx2 binaries and developer kit

      apt-get install sphinx2-bin libsphinx2-dev

   Install the Sphinx2 Perl bindings

      wget http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/D/DJ/DJHD/Speech-Recognizer-SPX-0.0801.tar.gz
      tar -xzf Speech-Recognizer-SPX-0.0801.tar.gz
      cd Speech-Recognizer-SPX-0.0801
      perl Makefile.PL --sphinx-prefix=/usr
      make && make test && make install

   Install Festival, and the 'kallpc8k' voice, sitable for telephone quality

      apt-get install festival festvox-kallpc8k

4. Install the Asterisk::AGI perl module

      wget http://asterisk.gnuinter.net/files/asterisk-perl-0.08.tar.gz
      tar -xzf asterisk-perl-0.08.tar.gz
      cd asterisk-perl-0.08
      perl Makefile.PL
      make && make test && make install 

5. Add some additional perl modules used by ZoIP from the apt repository

      apt-get install libproc-daemon-perl liblog-log4perl-perl libconfig-tiny-perl

6. Start the Sphinx2 daemon in a separate console. By default, it is set to NOT
   daemonize, and will print all sorts of messages to the console. If you want
   it to daemonize, set daemonize=1 in the [sphinx] section of zoip.conf

      /usr/local/games/zoip/sphinx_server.pl

7. Find some z-machine games to play! 

   Various games can be found around the net, simply search for 'interactive
   fiction', 'infocom', 'zork' and such things. The only part you will need is
   the .DAT file. Move them into the share/games folder in the zoip directory.

   We will bundle games once we find some that are licensed for free
   redistribution. 

8. Add ZoIP to your asterisk dialplan (usually in /etc/asterisk/extensions.conf),
   and specify a gamefile to play. zoip.agi will look for the game file in it's
   share/games folder, or alternatively, at the full path that you specify.

   i.e.
   
      [default]
      exten => 300,1,AGI(/usr/local/games/zoip/zoip.agi|ZORK1.DAT)

9. Tell asterisk to reload it's extensions.conf

      asterisk -rx 'extensions reload'

10. Call extension 300, and enjoy!

DEBUGGING:
---------

1. Turn verbosity up to '1' from the asterisk console, and try calling in again. 

*CLI> set verbose 1

2. Try executing the script from the command line, and pressing enter a few
   times. You should see something like this:

$ ./zoip.agi ZORK1.DAT
VERBOSE "Zasterisk: -->West of House<--" 1
VERBOSE "Zasterisk: Playing cached file" 3
